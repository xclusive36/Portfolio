# Portfolio

## Hello, This is my portfolio project for Module #2 for MSU Bootcamp.

I tried to create an eye appealing webpage that is fully dynamic, and mobile first.

It contains a header with my name and navigational links leading to each section of the website via anchor tags.

The first section tells the user a little about me, The next section showcases my recent coding projects. Each project is inside a card element with an image representing that project. Each project contains a url leading to that project.

The last section contains a button element with a email address link.

At the very bottom the website has a footer with a small text thanking the visitor.

The following is the project criteria to complete the project.



## AS AN employer
* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
* SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
